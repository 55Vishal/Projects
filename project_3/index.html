          <h1>Tulips</h1>
          <p>A red tulip represents a declaration of love, while a yellow represents declared hopeless love. A white bloom is representative of a person's worthiness or sometimes, to express forgiveness. Variegated, or striped, tulips are consistently popular and express the sentiment that someone has beautiful eyes.</p>

          <h1>Dahlia</h1>
          <p>Red dahlias typically symbolize some kind of strength and power, while those that are pink are associated most strongly with grace and kindness. Therefore, it's important that you carefully consider what meaning you want to convey when giving a red or pink dahlia, as the two shades can easily be confused.</p>

          <h1>Daffodils</h1>
          <p>Daffodils are some of the first flowers we see in springtime and are a great indicator that winter is over. Because of this, they are seen to represent rebirth and new beginnings.</p>
